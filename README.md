# some_TimeSeries_stuff
This project implements an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  time series model to forecast memory usage data. 
### The data_set "vmCloud_data" can be gotten from Kaggle.com 

## Project Overview
This project implements an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series model to forecast memory usage data. It utilizes historical memory usage data to train the model and then generates predictions for future memory usage trends. The project includes code for data preprocessing, model training, forecasting, and visualization of results.

## Code Explanation
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
Read CSV File: The initial step is to read the memory usage data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Specify Relevant Columns: We specify the names of the columns representing the timestamp and memory usage data.
Drop Unwanted Columns: All columns except the specified timestamp and memory usage columns are dropped from the DataFrame.
Convert Timestamp to Datetime: The timestamp column is converted to datetime format to facilitate time-based operations.
Sort DataFrame by Timestamp: The DataFrame is sorted in ascending order based on the timestamp column.
Handle Missing Values: Any rows with missing values in the memory usage or timestamp columns are dropped.
Resample Data: The data is resampled to an hourly frequency and aggregated to calculate the mean memory usage for each hour.

#### 2. Model Training (ARIMA)
Instantiate ARIMA Model: An ARIMA model is instantiated with the specified order (p, d, q) parameters. These parameters represent the number of autoregressive terms, differences, and moving average terms, respectively.

Fit Model to Data: The ARIMA model is trained using the resampled memory usage data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model's summary, including coefficients and statistical metrics, is printed to evaluate its performance.

#### 3. Forecasting
Forecast Next Hour: The ARIMA model is used to predict the memory usage for the next hour.

Plot Forecast: The forecasted memory usage for the next hour is visualized alongside the historical data using Matplotlib.
Usage

### Requirements: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels).
  Data: Prepare your memory usage data in a CSV format with timestamp and memory usage columns.
  
  Run Code: Execute the provided Python script to preprocess the data, train the ARIMA model, and generate forecasts.
  
  Review Results: Examine the model's performance metrics and visualize the forecasted memory usage trends.
### Additional Notes
  Experiment with different ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q) to optimize performance.
  Consider incorporating additional features or trying alternative models for comparison, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
